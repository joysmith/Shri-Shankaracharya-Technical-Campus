## Where to learn some c++ topics, I couldn't understand anything. I haven't attend any class, or i've been irregular, some of the concept i forgot.

- Take this c++ course in hindi here is the playlist [clink me](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLYz8uHU480j37APNXBdPz7YzAi4XlQUF)
- Disadvantage
  - old compiler turbo C++, is being used
  - mixed c and c++ code being used
  - but you can use in your answer writing
- Benefits
  - crash course and comprehensive
  - Good for helping you in exam
  - I already created some notes for you for the author so you don't have to make anything [clink me](https://github.com/joysmith/cpp-by-sourab-shukla-sir/tree/main)

## Where to get reference code for answer writing, Sir you only given us theory portion and little code

- You can use "E balagurusamy üìñ" book code example, (the book is mention in your syllabus)
- You can try my link i.e lab one[clink me](https://github.com/joysmith/cpp)
