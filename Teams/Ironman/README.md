# Code of conduct

This is a Code of Conduct for the Teams community. Code of Conduct and applies to all interactions here.

Be mindful of your language. Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:

- Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
- Threats of violence
- Deliberate intimidation
- Explicit or violent material
- Stalking or following
- Or any other kinds of harassment
- Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.

Be respectful. Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.

Be considerate. Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.

Be open minded. Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, I ask you report it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, I may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Team further project and identification of the participant as a harasser to other team members or the general public.
